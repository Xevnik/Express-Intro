# Express-Simple
----

A simple application to show the simplest possible static web server using express.js, vs an equivelant in Node.js.  The primary learning objectives are:

* npm install express --save
* require the `express` package
* initialize it
* concept of middleware (functions that happen before or after your own function handler)
* the asterisk, and where it should be placed in relation to the other app.get/post/etc. functions
